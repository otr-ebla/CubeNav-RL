# RL Cube Environment Navigation

This repository contains code for training a mobile robot agent to navigate in an environment with random static cubes using a variety of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an RL agent that can autonomously navigate in an environment filled with static cubes. The agent will learn to avoid collisions with the cubes and reach a target location using RL algorithms.

## Features

- Randomly generated environment with static cubes
- RL agent trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms
- Target location for the agent to reach
- Collision avoidance mechanism
